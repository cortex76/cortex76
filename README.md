- 👋 Hi, I’m Satish as @cortex76 on here.
- 👀 I’m interested in python, tcl/tk, c++, FORTRAN, Excel VBA, Process Automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tcl/tk, c++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tcl/tk, c++.
- 📫 How to reach me thoratsatish159@gmail.com

I have done Mtech in Design (Mechanical Engineering). I'd been exposed to Python from then,
I have grown lot of interest in coding. So, I started learning Python. I do lot of coding for 
my organizational works. It is mostly related to Post-processing process automation. Now,
I am exploring tk for GUI customization, because I think, as I know Python, it is easier to learn.
Recently, I have also started learning C++ for my project works.
As I said, I am mechanical engineer learning coding, so you can guess the competency level.

To further improve my coding skills, I am here. So, be my teacher!
